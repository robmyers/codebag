[LambdaMOO][] is a MUD server.  It is essentially a programmable chat
server.  That simplifies things a bit since one could write non-chat
networked applications on top of LambdaMOO.  "MOO" is just a shorthand
way to refer to LambdaMOO.

   - realms.jhc -- A module for JHCore which permits dividing up a MOO into several realms.   Each realm can have its own set of builders and realms limit where inter-realm connections may happen.   I made it for the educational MOO "Connections", but it should work on any JHCore-based MOO.
