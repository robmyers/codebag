The result of a quest to generate more header images for the WP theme [Travelogue](http://www.podq.com/travelogue/).

Probably obsolete for the WordPress 2.x version of the theme (Travelogue 2).

merge.py -- merges images from 'source` using captions from `source/info.txt`

Comes with sample source image and info.txt along with sample output to see what it does.
